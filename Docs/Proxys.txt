Movgrab currently supports http and ssltunnel proxys. These an either be set using the -p/-proxy command-line switches, or using the http_proxy and sshtunnel_proxy environment variables.

proxy URLs have the form:

	<type>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>

If no authentication is needed to use the proxy then the '<username>:<password>@' section can be ommited. 

'type' can be:
	http				A standard http proxy
	https				An http proxy that uses encrypted connections
	ssltunnel 	An ssh server that supports connection forwarding

All connections will then be forwarded through the proxy.
