As some of the video download sites that movgrab accesses use the 'IPad Streaming' technique, which involves the use of the .m3u container file, I decided to include support for container files in movgrab.

The main use for this is internet radio stations. These generally advertise themselves with a .m3u, .pls or .asx file, you download the file and within the file are details of where the radio stream can be found on the net.

Media players like mplayer can generally handle such streams without any assistance, however some players have less support than others. Also I have found that even mplayer and mpg123 have trouble with some streams, for example: http://www.triplag.com/webradio/darkpsy/triplag-darkpsy-playlist.asx

Using movgrab's "-o -" flag to stream the download to stdout, and then piping it into the player allows these problems to be overcome. So:

movgrab -o - 'http://www.triplag.com/webradio/darkpsy/triplag-darkpsy-playlist.asx' | mplayer - -cache 1024

Will get you your dark trance fix even if mplayer balks at the .asx file. Recent versions of mplayer require a -cache argument to stream from stdin. Even with this argument they complain about the cache emptying, but if you use a -cache it will eventually start to play. 

Similarly mpg123 can be used thusly

movgrab -o - 'http://www.triplag.com/webradio/darkpsy/triplag-darkpsy-playlist.asx' | mpg123 -

For ogg-vorbis streams there's "ogg123" which comes as part of the vorbis distrobution.

Of course, movgrab can also write the stream to a file, 

movgrab 'http://www.triplag.com/webradio/darkpsy/triplag-darkpsy-playlist.asx' -o darktrance.mp3

Best of all, a flag in the form '+o <path>' can be used to output the stream to a second (or third, or forth...) file, allowing you to listen to the stream and record it, thusly

movgrab 'http://www.triplag.com/webradio/darkpsy/triplag-darkpsy-playlist.asx' -o -  +o darktrance.mp3 | mpg123 -

This both pipes it into 'mpg123' and writes it to 'darktrance.mp3'





RADIO STATIONS:

There's a Europe wide list at http://www.listenlive.eu/index.html

Here are some of the highlights of it

BBC world service. mpg123 doesn't seem to like this .pls, but movgrab can handle it and pipe the output into mpg123
