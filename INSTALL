Movgrab compilation should be as simple as:

./configure
make
make install

You can use the --prefix argument to ./configure to specify an install root e.g.

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

The default is /usr/local

./configure will accept the arguments:

--enable-ssl

Which  enables https for downloading (not often useful)

and

--enable-largefiles		

Which enables support for downloading files large than 2G. This is a GNU extension, so may not work on all systems.
